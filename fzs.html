                        <p>An A&S (assist and slipper) clutch is adopted to reduce the weight of the clutch pull and
                            provide
                            low-stress shifting during deceleration. The A&S helps to reduce fatigue for the rider.
                            This also prevents excessive engine braking, thus reducing its effects on chassis behavior.
                            The A&S clutch makes for smooth, enjoyable downshifts.
