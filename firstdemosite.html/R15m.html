            <p><u>Yamaha R15M
                We R Racing Perfection
              </u><br><br>
              Born of Yamaha’s racing DNA that shaped
              legends like M1, The R1M and the R-series,
              The R15M takes the racing quotient to next
              level with stunning graphics, R1 inspired
              New Color TFT Meter, 3D Emblem & Special
              Seat, 155 CC LC4V SOHC FI ENGINE WITH VVA
              equipped with a Traction Control System and
              a Quick Shifter. Put your leathers on & hit the track.<br><br>
              <u>Dual Horn</u><br><br>

              In the bustling cities, a good horn can make the difference between being seen and noticed.
              Let the city hear you ride your way into the future. R15M has got that covered too.
              With new split horns delivering higher decibels and lower decibels (Dual Tone), here’s a
              racer that truly sounds like one.<br><br>
              <u>Aluminium Swingarm
              </u><br><br>

              The Aluminium Swingarm give you the advantage of significant reduction in unsprung
              weight which makes the bike easier to handle.<br><br>
              <u>E20 Fuel Compatible</u><br><br>
              E20 Fuel reduces the emissions and is wonderful option for cutting down on pollution.<br><br>
              <u>CLASS D BI-FUNCTIONAL HEADLIGHT UNIT</u><br><br>
              The new headlight features a single bi-functional LED unit emitting both the low and high beam.
              Characterized by increased brightness (Class-D), the unit’s light weight and compactness has
              enabled the new highly aerodynamic fairing (cowling) design.<br><br>
              <u>LED POSITION LIGHT</u><br><br>
              To give the face a strong visual impact despite its compact size, LED position lights were
              placed on the outer extremes of the machine to not only keep the frontal projected area small
              but also to create the commanding appearance of a big bike.<br><br>
              <u>LED FLASHERS</u><br><br>
              Signal your unique identity with unmissable front and back LED flashers - a perfect mash-up of style and
              safety.<br><br>
              <u>AERODYNAMIC BODY DESIGN</u><br><br>
              With better airflow management the rider can reach the top speed faster and is also helpful in the high
              speed stability of the machine.<br><br>
              <u>155 cc LC4V SOHC FI Engine with VVA
              </u><br><br>
              The liquid cooled single overhead camshaft fuel injection engine churns out a maximum horse power of
              13.5kW(18.
              4PS)/10000r/min and maximum torque of 14.2N.m (1.4kgf.m) / 7500r/min. What’s more the engine is equipped
              with a
              Traction Control System and a Quick Shifter (up-shift).

        <p>An A&S (assist and slipper) clutch is adopted to reduce the weight of the clutch pull and provide 
          low-stress shifting during deceleration. The A&S helps to reduce fatigue for the rider.
           This also prevents excessive engine braking, thus reducing its effects on chassis behavior. 
           The A&S clutch makes for smooth, enjoyable downshifts.
