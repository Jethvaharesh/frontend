              <h2><u>How to make Masala Dosa:-</u><br>
                1. First take all the ingredients in three bowls. Note that these
                ingredients are easily available online or any Indian or Asian grocery
                store if you live outside India.
                1.5 cups idli rice or parboiled rice in one bowl. You can also use
                regular short-grained to medium-grained rice like sona masuri or
                parmal.
                ½ cup urad dal (husked black gram) + 1 tablespoon chana dal (husked
                and split bengal gram) + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second
                bowl
                ⅓ cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl.<br>
                2. Rinse the lentils and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak
                them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.
                TIP: Ensure to use urad dal that are fresh and within their shelf-period.<br>
                3. Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.<br>
                4. Rinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice.<br>
                5. Pour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.<br>
                6. Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+fenugreek seeds and keep
                it for grinding urad dal. You can also use fresh water if you prefer.<br>
                7. Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to
                the lentils or ½ cup of fresh water if you like.<br>
                8. Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light
                and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the dosa batter ferments well.<br>
                9. Remove batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Below is a photo showing the consistency of the
                urad dal batter.
                Note that a well ground and fluffy urad dal batter helps in the fermentation process.<br>
                10. Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water.
                You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder
                jar.
                I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding.
                Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice. So you may need to add less or more water.<br>
                11. Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava
                (cream of wheat) like consistency of the ground rice grains.<br>
                12. Now pour the rice+flattened rice batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad lentil
                batter.<br>
