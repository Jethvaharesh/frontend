                            <u>Traction Control system</u> <br><br>
                            The MT-15 V2 comes with Traction Control System. This is a
                            dedicated electronic system that has the remarkable ability
                            of reducing the chances of a wheelspin (slippage due to loss
                            of traction)<br><br>
                            <u>155cc LC 4V FI Engine</u><br><br>
                            Powering the MT-15 V2 is the trusted and amazing 155cc Liquid
                            cooled 4-valve engine that gives you ample amount of power and
                            torque on tap.<br><br>
                            <u>Upside Down Front Forks</u><br><br>
                            The structure of the Upside Down front forks allows front wheel
                            ample room for free movement, which makes it easier for the bike
                            to navigate and change directions at higher speeds, making it
                            more agile, true to the character of MT-15.<br><br>
                            <u>Aluminium Swingarm</u><br><br>
                            Equipped with Aluminium Swingarm, MT-15 V2 zooms through any
                            terrain with utmost ease. It provides sportier and stable handling
                            due to excellent rigidity balance.<br><br>
                            <u>Variable Valve Actuation</u> <br><br>
                            Variable Valve Actuation (VVA) system provides top-end power without
                            sacrificing torquey character in the low to mid-rpm range.
                            There are two intake valve cams: one for low to mid-range
                            rpm and another for high rpm. They switch between each other
                            at the 7,400rpm mark to ensure good power and torque is present
                            throughout the rev range. <br><br>
                            <u>Assist & Slipper Clutch</u> <br><br>
                            An Assist and Slipper clutch (ASC) is adopted to reduce the
                            weight of the clutch pull and provide low-stress shifting during
                            deceleration. ASC helps to reduce fatigue for the rider.
                            This also prevents excessive engine braking, thus reducing
                            its effects on chassis behavior. ASC makes for smooth,
                            enjoyable downshifts.<br><br>
                            <u>Dual Channel ABS with 282 mm (Front) / 220 mm (Rear) Disk Brake</u><br><br>
                            Front & Rear Disc with Bosch Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) helps
                            in achieving greater control over the bike during braking by
                            restricting the wheel lock ups thereby maintaining tractive contact with the
                            road surface to avoid skidding in slippery conditions.
                            This ensures a confident inspiring ride and let the rider enjoy the
                            ride to the fullest.<br><br>
                            <u>140mm Super Wide Radial Rear Tyre
                            </u><br><br>
                            MT-15 V2 tackles high speeds with ease. The 140mm radial rear tyre has been
                            adapted with flexible sidewalls for better grip while cornering and has
                            superior shock-absorbing capacity to ensure a more comfortable ride <br> Read more...
