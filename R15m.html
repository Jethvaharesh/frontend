                <p><u>Yamaha R15M
                  We R Racing Perfection
                  </u><br><br>
                  Born of Yamaha’s racing DNA that shaped
                   legends like M1, The R1M and the R-series, 
                   The R15M takes the racing quotient to next
                    level with stunning graphics, R1 inspired
                     New Color TFT Meter, 3D Emblem & Special
                      Seat, 155 CC LC4V SOHC FI ENGINE WITH VVA 
                      equipped with a Traction Control System and 
                      a Quick Shifter. Put your leathers on & hit the track.<br><br>
                      <u>Dual Horn</u><br><br>

                    In the bustling cities, a good horn can make the difference between being seen and noticed.
                   Let the city hear you ride your way into the future. R15M has got that covered too. 
                   With new split horns delivering higher decibels and lower decibels (Dual Tone), here’s a
                    racer that truly sounds like one.<br><br>
                    <u>Aluminium Swingarm
                      </u><br><br>
                     
                     The Aluminium Swingarm give you the advantage of significant reduction in unsprung 
                     weight which makes the bike easier to handle.<br><br>
                     <u>E20 Fuel Compatible</u><br><br>
                     E20 Fuel reduces the emissions and is wonderful option for cutting down on pollution.<br><br>
                    <u>CLASS D BI-FUNCTIONAL HEADLIGHT UNIT</u><br><br>
                    The new headlight features a single bi-functional LED unit emitting both the low and high beam.
                     Characterized by increased brightness (Class-D), the unit’s light weight and compactness has
                      enabled the new highly aerodynamic fairing (cowling) design.<br><br>
                      <u>LED POSITION LIGHT</u><br><br>
                      To give the face a strong visual impact despite its compact size, LED position lights were 
                      placed on the outer extremes of the machine to not only keep the frontal projected area small 
                      but also to create the commanding appearance of a big bike.<br><br>
                      <u>LED FLASHERS</u><br><br>
                      Signal your unique identity with unmissable front and back LED flashers - a perfect mash-up of style and safety.<br><br>
                      <u>AERODYNAMIC BODY DESIGN</u><br><br>
                      With better airflow management the rider can reach the top speed faster and is also helpful in the high speed stability of the machine.<br><br>
                      <u>155 cc LC4V SOHC FI Engine with VVA
                      </u><br><br>
                      The liquid cooled single overhead camshaft fuel injection engine churns out a maximum horse power of 13.5kW(18.
                      4PS)/10000r/min and maximum torque of 14.2N.m (1.4kgf.m) / 7500r/min. What’s more the engine is equipped with a
                       Traction Control System and a Quick Shifter (up-shift).
