                                How to Make Kaju Masala Curry:-<br>
                                1:- To a pan on medium heat, add 2 teaspoons ghee. Then add 1 cup whole cashews and
                                sauté,
                                stirring often until the cashews turn light golden brown in color, around 2 to 3
                                &nbsp;minutes.
                                Remove cashews from pan on a plate and set aside.<br>
                                2:- To the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon ghee and 1 tablespoon oil. Once hot, add the
                                whole spices- 1-inch cinnamon stick, 1 bay leaf, 2-3 whole cloves, 1 star anise and 1
                                teaspoon shahi jeera. Let the spices sizzle for 30 seconds.<br>
                                3:- Then add 1.5 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder and cook the chili powder in the oil
                                for 10 to 15 seconds until you see a nice bright red color.<br>
                                4:- Then add the finely chopped onion (from 1 medium red onion, I used my food/onion
                                chopper
                                to chop it really fine). Stir well and cook the onions for around 5 minutes, stirring
                                often.<br>
                                5:- Add the finely chopped ginger and garlic (from 5 large garlic cloves and 1.5 inch
                                ginger),
                                stir and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
                                6- Then add the tomatoes (sorry I lost the photos for this step :(). But puree or grate
                                or use
                                your food processor to really finely chop/blend 3 medium tomatoes and add that to the
                                pan. Stir,
                                then cover and and cook the tomatoes for 7 to 8 minutes until they are completely cooked
                                and oil
                                is oozing from the sides.<br>
                                7:- Add the spices- 1 teaspoon coriander powder, 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon fennel powder
                                (start with 1/2
                                and add remaining 1/4 if you prefer more of the fennel flavor, I do add 3/4 teaspoon),
                                remaining
                                1/4 teaspoon of Kashmiri red chili powder (this is optional if you want a brighter red
                                color),
                                3/4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon sugar. Also add 1/4 cup (2 oz) water along with. Stir
